(How it works)



### So what exactly does Rosenpass do again?

Today, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are a cornerstone of the modern internet. Whenever you connect to your workplace from your "home office", you would most probably, consciously or not, use a VPN software to ensure that all data flowing from your computer at home to your employer's office are safe from being tangled with.

There are many more common, daily usecases, from online research to circumventing location-based (and -regulated) online services.

For people in countries that do "regulate" their citizens' internet usage in a more aggressive way, VPNs have become a ubiquous source of online "mobility" through different regulatory environments, enabling access to uncensored information and communication. Some evil governments even make using them a criminal offence.

As VPNs became a common internet standard, certain "protocols", ways to do it in technical terms, also became standards. Today's most important VPN standard is the free and open source software WireGuard(c).

In recent years, "Quantum Computers" became visible at the horizon of the future; computers so powerful they could break any standard cryptography that today ensures the safety of our online banking or simply the authenticity of a website pretending to be the BBC, the Reuters news bureau, your favorite low-cost airline etc.

ROSENPASS is an important precaution against what is about to come: A safeguard, a computer programme installed and run in parallel to WireGuard, making it immune against Quantum Computer attacks. ROSENPASS doesn't change the way WireGuard works (in fact WireGuard continues working properly in any case), but adds encryption that cannot be broken by the Quantum Computers that are about to enter our online living space.

ROSENPASS is free and open source software, developed independently by cryptographers and scientists with the help of a grant by the Dutch philanthropic foundation Stichtig NLnet.

It’s complicated. We know.
