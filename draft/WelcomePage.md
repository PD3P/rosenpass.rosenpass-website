Make your VPN Quantum-Secure!

Welcome to Project ROSENPASS !

ROSENPASS is innovative software that protects VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) against attacks with Quantum Computers.

++Quantum Secure++

ROSENPASS adds quantum security (PQS) to the well-established WireGuard protocol, enabling VPN (Virtual Private Network) appliances that are hardened against quantum computer attacks while preserving the existing cryptographic security as a fail-safe fallback state.


++Works with WireGuard++

Adding ROSENPASS to your WireGuard installation lifts your VPNs security to the max. Today and in the future.
