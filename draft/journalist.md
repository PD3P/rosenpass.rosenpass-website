ROSENPASS provides a complement to the well-recognised WireGuard standard, adding quantum-hardened cryptography and key exchange while keeping the established WireGuard-standard encryption security. Therefore, ROSENPASS is not just an add-on or a plug-in, but a coprocessing software that interacts with WireGuard at exactly one point, enhancing WireGuards predefined key generation and exchange process with Post Quantum Secure (PQS) cryptography, based on the McEliece cryptosystem.

ROSENPASS is Free and Open Source Software, publically reviewable and adaptable, published under the Apache 2.0 and MIT Licenses. See the Download section for detailed License information.

ROSENPASS is formally verifiable state-of-the-art Post Quantum Cryptography, groundbreakingly improving the security of a cornerstone to the internet.

Project ROSENPASS is run by a team of cryptographers, researchers, open source developers, hackers and design artists; with focus on verifiable security improvement, usability and user advantage.

It comes as a small package at a Github-repository, easy to install and maintain with your WireGuard installation. At present, a new repository installation/addition is required, as the software is not packaged by standard yet.

ROSENPASS is written in Rust, the philosophy behind its approach being to provide for code that is readable and legitimable in retrospect with implementations and improvements to come, thereby keeping the non-specified part of the system’s behaviour explicable in the future.

ROSENPASS is a technology project, too. In the future, it may very well be adapted to other key elements of today’s internet security, preserving trust and safety in the coming Quantum era.

In short, ROSENPASS will not just improve today’s internet, it will help keeping it going in the future.
