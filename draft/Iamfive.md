Cryptographers are people who work on making your phone, tablet, or laptop more secure. They create calculations that are so complicated to undo that they can be used to create envelopes for messages that cannot be opened unless you have the key. These envelopes can be created by any computer; your phone, tabled, or laptop is creating many of these right now.

This technology has been working very well for years, but when somebody manages to build a quantum computer they may be able to open up these envelopes without the key. Quantum computers use properties of the smallest things that exist – atoms – to perform calculations. These new computers are difficult to use and good at few things, but they happen to be very good at opening most of the envelopes created by cryptographers.

There are many ways to create envelopes that cannot be opened by quantum computers. Cryptographers have been holding competitions to find out whose envelopes are the best. Some winners where found, and now cryptographers are working hard to allow all computers – including yours – to create these envelopes that cannot be opened by quantum computers.

Rosenpass is a part of this effort. We want to allow a program called WireGuard to create these envelopes. Our program called Rosenpass joins WireGuard; they work together to protect network messages better than either could on their own.
