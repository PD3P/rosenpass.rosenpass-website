blerb: "The Rosenpass tool is a daemon, written in Rust, that implements the Rosenpass protocol to create and exchange hybridised post-quantum and
 classically secure keys between two peers. Using a hybrid security model allows us to preserve the reliability of battle-proven classical 
 cryptography whilst still providing the necessary upgrade to secure against decryption of data by quantum computers (i.e., protect against 
 “store-now decrypt-later attacks”).

 
The Rosenpass tool works best and most natively with [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), as it was first envisioned specifically to inject post-quantum secured keys 
into WireGuard using its Pre-Shared Key parameter. However, as the Rosenpass tool can export its shared secrets to a file, it can be implemented 
in other use cases. We were able to demonstrate its potential for integration with Transport Layer Security (TLS), in [this tutorial](/blog/tlsrosenpass_july) on using 
[OpenSSL](https://openssl.org/) with Rosenpass."

        <ul class="pe-3">
          <li> Fixes vulnerability to prevent output shared key (OSK) to be set or written again on a responder receiving the same InitConf message during a handshake.</li>
          <li> This release has no impact for majority of users using Rosenpass with Wireguard</li>

<h2>What planned features are on the way?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Cunicu integration:</b> <a href="https://cunicu.li">Cunicu</a> is a user-space daemon for managing WireGuard connections for small devices. We intend to integrate post-quantum security into that daemon via Rosenpass</li>
    <li><b>Docker and micro-VM implementations:</b> We are currently working on using micro-VMs to reduce the scope of system privileges Rosenpass needs to run</li>
    <li><b>Hacspec integration:</b> Hackspec is a rust-based language designed by <a>Cryspen</a> to enable the use of several formal verification tools that enable high-assurance cryptography</li>
    <li><b>Golang implementation of Rosenpass:</b> Our initial implementation of Rosenpass is written in Rust, but we are working on an alternative, compatible Golang-built implementation to increase diversity and reach new platforms. 	
	It is called <a href="https://github.com/cunicu/go-rosenpass">go-rosenpass</a>. 	</li>
