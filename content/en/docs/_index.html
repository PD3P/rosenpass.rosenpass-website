<p>
Welcome to the documentation page for Rosenpass. This guide contains the manual pages, slides from various presentations,
as well as links to both our scientific whitepaper and the github repository for the Rosenpass source code.
</p>

<h2>What is Rosenpass?</h3>
  <p>
    Rosenpass is a daemon, that, given a private key and a list of peers, performs a key exchange with each peer. 
    The resulting keys are given to WireGuard using its PSK feature â€“ WireGuard remains as secure as it was, Rosenpass adds 
    protection against quantum computers. Rosenpass can also write the keys to files; this can be used to integrate Rosenpass 
    with tools other than WireGuard. It can also be exported to an outfile.
  </p>

<h2>Who is Rosenpass for?</h2>
  <p>
	Rosenpass is for everyone who wants secure encryption, particularly in a world where "store now, decrypt later" attacks are considered to be a present threat. If your data is being encrypted with methods that are not post-quantum secure, that data may 
    already be vulnerable to harvest attacks relying on future access to quantum computing. The goal of Rosenpass is to protect
    everyone from that future, much as classical encryption methods protect everyone in a pre-quantum world. That said, there is
     a skill-floor to using the currently available implementations of Rosenpass. Typically, developers with some experience of 
     manually configured VPNs will have the easiest time setting up the Rosenpass demon, particularly those using specific versions
      of Linux. Support for further systems is actively being researched, but is not currently imminent.
  </p>
<h2>How to use this Guide</h2>
  <p>
    If you simply want to get Rosenpass up and running quickly, you are best served using the <a href="https://rosenpass.eu/docs/quick_start">Quick Start Guide</a>
    It contains everything you need to download, configure, and start a WireGuard connection using the Rosenpass key exchange. Much of the rest of the guide
    is aimed at both scientific explanation and technical guides to the implementation. It is also intended to host many of our conference presentations.
  </p>
<h2>Which systems currently support Rosenpass?</h2>
  <p>
    Rosenpass currently provides packages and static binaries for several Linux distributions, as shown below. Further packages and support are planned, with 
    development of a Golang implementation, to complement our current Rust build, expected to help with that process.

<h2>What planned features are on the way?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Cunicu integration:</b> <a href="https://cunicu.li">Cunicu</a> is user-space daemon for managing WireGuard connections for small devices. We intend to integrate post-quantum security into that daemon via Rosenpass</li>
    <li><b>Docker and micro-VM implementations:</b> We are currently working on using micro-VMs to reduce the scope of system privileges Rosenpass needs to run</li>
    <li><b>Hacspec integration:</b> Hackspec is a rust-based language designed by <a>Cryspen</a> to enable the use of several formal verification tools that enable high-assurance cryptography</li>
    <li><b>NetBird partnership:</b> We are working with <a>NetBird</a> to produce a commercially-ready VPN service that is post-quantum secure</li>
    <li><b>Golang implementation of Rosenpass:</b> We are currently working on a Golang-built implementation of Rosenpass to increase its ease-of-use in wider environments</li>
  </ul>
