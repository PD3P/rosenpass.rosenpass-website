blerb: "Rosenpass is a project to produce free/libre, open source, and open science cryptographic tooling to aid the migration of the internet's
 infrastructure towards post-quantum secure cryptography, e.g encryption and authentication. 
 
 
 Currently, the project consists of the Rosenpass 
 protocol, its implementation in the Rosenpass tool, and a cryptographic analysis of its security using [ProVerif](https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/proverif/). We focus our work towards better 
 integration of academic cryptography, the development of software, and its deployment in industry and infrastructure."
