## What is Rosenpass?
 
{{< /blocks/lead >}}

<div class="about">

{{< blocks/section color="white" >}}

**Rosenpass** is free and **open-source** software based on the latest research in the field of **cryptography**. It is intended to be used with **WireGuard VPN**, but can work with all software that uses pre-shared keys. It uses two cryptographic methods (Classic McEliece and Kyber) to secure systems against attacks with **quantum computers**.

**Rosenpass** is also a **science communication** project that intends to make cryptography easy to understand for everyone. 

#### "Explain it like I'm..."

On that note, we have provided a series in-depth of explanations about what **Rosenpass** does at different levels. 
Pick whatever you feel suits you best! :D

#### What is cryptograhpy?
Have you ever tried to write a message to a friend that only they could read? You might have told them: "Take each letter and move it forward four places in the alphabet!" And then you would have moved each letter four places backward before writing it down. Encryption is basically like that, but *a lot* more complicated! And you can do other useful stuff with it. For example make sure the message really comes from the person it claims to be from.

#### Why do we need cryptography?
Without cryptography, every message you send on your phone or computer could be read by everyone on the way between you and the receiver of that message. It's like sending a letter without an envelope! That might not be such a big problem for the GIFs you send to your friends (We also send postcards without envelopes, after all!), but there are parts of our communication that really shouldn't be public. Like when you buy something online: If you sent your credit card data unencrypted, it would mean that everyone could read that data and go buy something with your money!

#### What is a quantum computer?
Regular Computers only know two states: 0 (= power off) and 1 (= power on). When you send data on a regular comupter, it maps every letter to a long sequence of ones and zeros.
All over the world, scientists are trying to build computers that use quantum mechanics to have more than just these two states, because that would make them much faster than the computers we have today. They made prototypes that kind of work, but they are huge, unstable (because they are super sensitve to their environment) and can't really do much, yet. 



#### What makes quantum computers so bad for cryptography?
This technology has been working very well for years, but people are working to undo all the hard work. Some people are working to build quantum computers, which are a special type of computer that can open these locks even without the key. Quantum computers take advantage of the properties of the smallest particles in existence to perform calculations that are too challenging for normal computers. Quantum computers are difficult to use and good at few things, but they happen to be very good at opening most of the locks created by cryptographers.

#### What can we do to protect our encryption against quantum computers?
Cryptographers are scientists who's job is to think of new ways to encrypt stuff and make sure they really work. But they also try to break the encryption methods we already have. Because if they can do it, attackers might also be able to! These scientists also know that quantum computers are coming. That's why they've been thinking ahead and found a few cyphers that don't have a weakness against quantum computers. Or at least, nobody found a way to break them, yet!



There are many ways to create locks that cannot be opened by quantum computers. Cryptographers have been holding competitions to find out whose locks are the most secure. Some frontrunners have been decided upon, and now cryptographers are working hard to allow all computers to create these locks. When they are done, even quantum computers will not be able to break the locks that your computer creates.

#### What is a VPN?
A VPN or Virtual Private Network is like a tunnel that you can send your messages through, so that nobody can see them. Not even when and where they go to! This tunnel is also made of encryption! Many companies use VPNs so that their employees who work from home or are on a business trip can connect to the company network. This makes sure that their competitiors or people who want to harm them can't know what they are working on. 
But you can also use a VPN at home. There are many providers that offer easy to use VPN software. 

#### What is WireGuard?
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are a cornerstone of the modern internet. VPNs can be used for anonymisation, to circumvent location-based website locks, and to get better deals in online stores. Whenever you connect to your workplace from your home, you are likely using a VPN to encrypt the connection. For people in countries that regulate their citizens' internet usage aggressively, VPNs have become a way to access uncensored information and free communication. One important current VPN technology is called WireGuardÂ®.

WireGuard is considered to be excellent by most professionals. It is fast, secure, and very efficient, but there is nonetheless a problem on the horizon threatening its security. Quantum computers may be able to break all modern cryptosystems within a couple of years from now. With this breakage, all systems on the internet, from personal messages to banking, will be threatened by both criminals and state actors. Even data sent today is affected by this threat, as espionage agencies can store data transmitted today and decrypt it in the future.

#### What is Rosenpass?
Rosenpass is part of this wider effort. Our program allows another program called WireGuard to create safe locks, even against quantum computers. Rosenpass and WireGuard work together to better protect network messages better either could on their own.


#### How can I use Rosenpass?

Rosenpass can be used to protect against that risk. The application can be installed to run in parallel to WireGuard, protecting it from quantum attacks. Rosenpass doesn't change the way WireGuard works, its encryption remains as it was in its standard implementation, except for the provision of an additional key that cannot be broken by the quantum computers.

Rosenpass provides a complement to the well-known WireGuard protocol, adding quantum-hardened cryptography and key exchange while keeping the established WireGuard standard encryption security. So Rosenpass functions as an add-on, enhancing WireGuard's key negotiation process with Post Quantum Secure (PQS) cryptography, based a combination of Classic McEliece and Kyber.

Rosenpass is free and open-source software. This means it can be publicly reviewed and adapted by other developers for their purposes. All contributions to Rosenpass are provided both under a Apache 2.0 and an MIT License. When using Rosenpass itself, the user may choose under which license to use Rosenpass.
(See the [License](/#license) section for detailed information.) 

Rosenpass uses symbolically verified, state-of-the-art cryptography. This project is part of a wider effort to break new ground in improving the security of an important component of the public internet.

The project is run by a team of cryptographers, researchers, open-source developers, hackers and designers. We emphasise verifiable security, usability, and science communication. It is provided as a small package in a GitHub repository, and is easy to install and maintain alongside your WireGuard installation.

Rosenpass is written in Rust. The application serves as a reference implementation. It aids developers in implementing and adapting the protocol to other systems by providing readable source code and ample documentation. The software developed to implement Rosenpass can be easily adapted to other pieces of the internet security landscape, preserving trust and safety of future networks.

Rosenpass implements a post-quantum-secure key exchange in the spirit of the [Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/). The motivating use case is integrating with the WireGuard VPN. In this mode, the shared secret generated by Rosenpass is supplied to WireGuard as its pre-shared symmetric key (PSK). This results in a WireGuard VPN connection with hybrid post-quantum security.

While Rosenpass is designed with WireGuard in mind, it can be used as a stand-alone tool to exchange keys. Using this mode, it can be employed to secure other protocols against attacks from quantum computers. The other protocol needs to provide security, assuming a secure PSK is used for this to work. To use this mode, the `rosenpass` binary must be used together with the `outfile <FILE>` parameter. Rosenpass will write a key to the given file every two minutes, and print a message on standard out to notify the user or the calling script that the key has changed.

The implementation is written in Rust but uses libsodium and liboqs, both of which are C libraries. This does not result in pretty code everywhere, but enables some advanced security features. We use a couple of techniques to make sure the code is secure. We use variable colouring (gating use of a secret value through a `.secret()` method), and the code zeroises all key material.

The Rosenpass protocol provides a post-quantum-secure authenticated key exchange, based on the work "Post-quantum WireGuard" (PQWG) by HÃ¼lsing, Ning, Schwabe, Weber, and Zimmermann [^pqwg]. Apart from some tweaks to the protocol internals, we provide security against what we call _state disruption attacks_ as a major contribution.

Both the classic WireGuard protocol (WG)[^wg] and PQWG rely on a timestamp to protect against replay of the first protocol message. By setting the system time to a future date, an attacker can trick the initiator into generating a kill-packet that can be used to inhibit future handshakes without special access. This renders the initiator's static key pair practically useless. Assuming an attacker's ability to modify the system time is realistic due to the use of the insecure NTP protocol on many systems, as described in [WireGuard CVE-2021-46873](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-46873).

Instead of attempting to protect against replay attacks on the first protocol message, Rosenpass uses a stateless responder, so replay of the first message leads to no attack. To achieve this, we move the responder state into an encrypted cookie and have the responder include it with their message. The initiator returns this cookie in their reply, so the responder can restore it before processing the reply.

In practice, Rosenpass is meant to be used together with WireGuard to achieve hybrid post-quantum security. In this scenario, WireGuard is still used as the main VPN protocol for transporting data while Rosenpass runs on the side and supplies the WireGuard implementation with keys to be used as the pre-shared key (PSK) during its handshake. Just like WireGuard, Rosenpass executes a new handshake every two minutes.

A cryptographic proof of security is in the works. At this time, we provide a symbolic analysis of the protocol using ProVerif and a practical implementation of the protocol in the Rust programming language. The implementation uses cryptographic primitives from liboqs [^liboqs] and libsodium [^libsodium].
