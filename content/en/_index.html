{{< blocks/feature icon="" title="Quantum Secure" >}}
<strong>Rosenpass</strong> adds quantum security (PQS) to the well-established WireGuard protocol, enabling VPN (Virtual Private Network) appliances that are hardened against quantum computer attacks while preserving the existing cryptographic security as a fail-safe fallback state.
{{< /blocks/feature >}}


{{< blocks/feature icon="" title="Works with WireGuard" url="" >}}
Adding <strong>Rosenpass</strong> to your WireGuard installation lifts your VPNs security to the max. Today and in the future.

**Rosenpass** works as an addition to WireGuard, implementing post quantum secure encryption whilst keeping WireGuards untangled with as a fallback level, should **Rosenpass** fail for any reason in the future.

Therefore, **Rosenpass** is to be installed conjointly with an active WireGuard installation.

**Rosenpass** is no app, but software to be manually installed. It is not yet packaged. See the download section.

What **Rosenpass** does is essentially adding an advanced key exchange process and improved cryptography that is concurrently deemed quantum secure, i.e. secure against attacks by quantum computers of different kinds.

The binary can be installed through cargo (the Rust package manager) and we are also providing static binaries.

**Rosenpass** is lightweight and doesn't significantly consume extra resources.

You can test proper installation / implementation of Rosenpass by checking like this:
